  // Name of the connector instance for managing user data.
  
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSinkConnector", 
    // Specifies that this is an Elasticsearch sink connector, used to push data from Kafka to Elasticsearch.
    
    "tasks.max": "1", 
    // Limits the connector to 1 task, meaning only one worker will handle data transfer to Elasticsearch.
    
    "topics": "dbserver1.search_optimization_db.users", 
    // The Kafka topic to consume data from, in this case for the "users" table from the "search_optimization_db" database.

    "key.ignore": "false", 
    // Ensures that the key from the Kafka message (e.g., user_id) is used in Elasticsearch to uniquely identify documents.
    
    "connection.url": "http://elasticsearch:9200", 
    // The URL of the Elasticsearch cluster to which the connector will send the data.

    "schema.ignore": "false", 
    // Indicates that the connector will respect the schema information from the Kafka record, ensuring correct mapping to Elasticsearch fields.

    "type.name": "_doc", 
    // Specifies the document type in Elasticsearch, typically "_doc" is used for indexing.

    "behavior.on.null.values": "delete", 
    // If a Kafka message contains a null value, the corresponding document will be deleted from Elasticsearch.
    
    "transforms": "unwrap,extractKey", 
    // A list of transformations to apply to the Kafka messages before sending to Elasticsearch. "unwrap" and "extractKey" will be applied.

    "transforms.unwrap.type": "io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState", 
    // The "unwrap" transform removes the Debezium envelope around the change event, leaving just the updated record fields.

    "transforms.unwrap.drop.tombstones": "false", 
    // Keeps tombstone messages (which indicate deleted records) in the Kafka topic. These are used to trigger the "delete" operation in Elasticsearch.

    "transforms.extractKey.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ExtractField$Key", 
    // The "extractKey" transform is used to extract the key field from the Kafka message, which will be used as the document ID in Elasticsearch.

    "transforms.extractKey.field": "user_id" 
    // Specifies the field to extract from the Kafka message key, which is "user_id", and this will be used as the Elasticsearch document ID.
